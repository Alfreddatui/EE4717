# EE4717 Web Application Design
## Overview
This project is to appy HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL knowledge that we learned from the lectures. It is an interesting course and 1 sentence that can describe the course is "Do not procrastinate about doing your project instead try to build your project **ASAP** and after that you can improve it by adding "_fancy_"  features".
## Installation
- Clone the github
- Run your PHP server (if you are using MAC, there is a built in PHP server, just follow the guide [here](https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/get-apache-mysql-php-and-phpmyadmin-working-on-macos-sierra/))
- open the directory from your PHP server (if it is local, it is "localhost").
